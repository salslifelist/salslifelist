# üí´ About Me:
üõ† I‚Äôm currently working on<br>Developing predictive analytics models, NLP projects, and showcasing my data science skills through various projects on GitHub and Kaggle. Some of my focus areas include , document classification and Named Entity Recognition, sentiment analysis, and creative applications of language models.<br><br>üë• I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on<br>Projects related to natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and applied AI in business contexts. I'm particularly interested in collaborations on language models, sentiment analysis, and text generation tasks.<br><br>üß† I‚Äôm looking for help with<br>Enhancing my skills in advanced NLP techniques, especially in areas like transformer models, prompt engineering, and conversational AI. I'm also keen on learning best practices for deploying machine learning models in cloud environments.<br><br>üå± I‚Äôm currently learning<br>Advanced NLP concepts, including transformer models and fine-tuning language models for specific applications. I‚Äôm also expanding my skills in cloud computing (AWS) and exploring ethical and regulatory aspects of AI.<br><br>üí¨ Ask me about<br>Applied machine learning, data wrangling, data visualization, natural language processing, or anything related to the use of AI for business problem-solving. I'm always happy to discuss different approaches to solving data challenges!<br><br>‚ö° Fun fact<br>In addition to data science, I have a background in English language and Linguistics, which inspires my interest in NLP and the ways technology can intersect with human expression and storytelling.
